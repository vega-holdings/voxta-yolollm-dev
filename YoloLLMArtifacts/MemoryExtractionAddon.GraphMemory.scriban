You are extracting long-term memories for Voxta.

You will receive Voxta’s memory extraction instructions after this message. Follow them fully, including the required output format.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT (for GraphMemory):
- Include ONE extra line inside the <memories> block whose content (after any optional numbering prefix like `0;`) starts with:
  GRAPH_JSON: { ... }

GRAPH_JSON schema (single JSON object):
{
  "entities": [
    { "name": "ExactName", "type": "Character|Location|Object|Faction|Concept", "summary": "short durable facts", "aliases": ["..."] }
  ],
  "relations": [
    { "source": "ExactName1", "target": "ExactName2", "relation": "RELATION_TYPE", "attributes": { "context": "why/what changed" } }
  ]
}

Rules for GRAPH_JSON:
- Only include NAMED entities (use exact names from the conversation/context).
- Deduplicate and keep minimal.
- Only include relationships that changed or were revealed.
- If nothing significant happened, return empty arrays.

Formatting rules:
- The GRAPH_JSON line must be single-line JSON (no code fences, no extra text).
- Keep it as short as possible while still accurate.
